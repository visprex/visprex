Visualise your CSV files without sending your data anywhere

## Load your data in your browser
Visprex processes and visualises your data in your browser without sending your data to any backend servers.
Only network calls this application has are those downloading example datasets. Once you upload your CSV file, it will automatically parse your data into either categorical or numerical types.

## Visualise your data
### Histogram

There are built-in data transformation methods e.g. mean centering, natural log and base-10 log transformations.

### Scatterplot
You can choose two variables to visualise on a 2D scatterplot. The variable you choose first will show up on the X-axis and the second variable will be on the Y-axis.
Data transformation methods will help you find a log-linear or log-log linear relationship between variables. 
Hovering over individual points will show you the details of that instance.

## Quickly investigate linear relationships
You can find linear correlations for any pair of variables from the correlation map, where blue indicates positive correlation and red indicates negative correlation.
